\usage{
\method{plot}{optint_by_group}(object, plot.vars = "sig",
  graph.col = NULL, alpha = 0.05, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an optint_by_group object.}

\item{plot.vars}{which variables to plot? either a number (n) -
indicating to plot the first n variables,
"sig" (default) - plot only significant variables
(here significant means that variabe is signifcant for
at least one group, or that there is significant heterogeneity),
or a vector with names of variables to plot.}

\item{graph.col}{graph color/s.}

\item{alpha}{significance level for the confidence intervals. also
used in order to determine which variables are significant.}
